# Towards-adversarially-robust-representation

In this work we attepmt to increase the robustness of deep neural networks agianst adversarial attacks. We investigate different techniques to achieve this goal. Each notebook is expoloring a different idea. 

You need: 
Python3.5 or above, Pytorch, numpy, and matplotlib to run the notebooks.
